## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file & add more components folder and add component.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. I ran `npm install` but get errors. What should I do?
- Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed (v18 or above recommended).  
- Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. `npm run dev` doesn’t start the server.
- Ensure no other process is using port `3000`.  
- You can try running on a different port:
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### 3. The page doesn’t auto-refresh when I make changes.
- Make sure you are editing files inside the `app` or `components` folder.  
- Check if your browser has caching issues; try a hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + R`).  
- Restart the development server if hot reloading fails.

### 4. I’m seeing font-related issues.
- This project uses the **Geist font** via `next/font`. Make sure your internet connection allows font downloads.  
- Try clearing the `.next` cache and restarting:
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 5. Can I use `bun` or `pnpm` instead of npm?
Yes! The project supports multiple package managers. Just make sure to use the equivalent commands:  
- `pnpm install` → `pnpm dev`  
- `bun install` → `bun dev`

### 6. I want to contribute but don’t know where to start.
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` in the GitHub repository.  
- Start by adding or improving components in the `components` folder.  
- Follow the **Contributor Instructions** section in this README.
